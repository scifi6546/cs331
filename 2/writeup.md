 Get the file check_haskell.hs from the class Git repository. This is a Haskell source file for a complete program. When it is executed, this program prints “Secret message #2:”. Below that, it prints a secret message. Run the program. What is the secret message?

Note. There are several ways to run this program. One of them is to start up the GHCi interactive Haskell environment, type “:l check_haskell” at the prompt (that is a lower-case ELL after the colon), and then at the next prompt, type “main”.
