{-
  The assignment requires sumEvenOdd to be written using a fold.
  Something like this:

    sumEvenOdd xs = fold* ... xs where
        ...

  Above, "..." should be replaced by other code. The "fold*" must be
  one of the following: foldl, foldr, foldl1, foldr1.
-}
sumEvenOdd _ = (0, 0)  -- DUMMY; REWRITE THIS!!!
